# Forest Fire Analysis in Montesinho Natural Park, Portugal

This project presents a data-driven investigation into forest fires occurring in Montesinho Natural Park, Portugal. Conducted as part of a BI-focused course project, the study aims to identify patterns in wildfire behavior using environmental and meteorological data, and offer actionable insights to mitigate fire damage.

## ðŸŒ² Project Summary

Forest fires in Montesinho threaten biodiversity, tourism, and ecological balance. Despite conservation efforts, increasing fire incidents demand deeper analysis. Our project uses fire-related indices (FWI, FFMC, ISI, DC, DMC, etc.) derived from temperature, wind speed, and humidity to determine key factors influencing wildfire spread and intensity.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Forest Fire Montesinho](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitm004/forest-fire-area)
- **Features Analyzed**:  
  - FFMC, ISI, DC, DMC (fire weather indices)  
  - Temperature, Rain, Wind, Relative Humidity  
  - Date and Area of fire spread  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Identify correlations between environmental indicators and forest fire occurrence.
- Visualize relationships between fire indices and weather parameters.
- Support stakeholders in preemptive action and policy design for wildfire prevention.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Insights

Built using **Tableau**, our dashboard includes:
- Monthly trends in fire incidents
- Correlation between ISI and wind speed
- Relationship between DC/DMC and temperature
- Relative humidity vs. fire frequency
- Heatmaps and line charts highlighting seasonal risk

### Key Findings:
- High **wind speed** and **ISI** significantly contribute to fire spread.
- **Temperature** plays a major role in ignition, especially in dry months.
- **DC and DMC** indexes correlate with temperature but not necessarily with humidity.
- **Fire incidents peak in low-humidity months**, reinforcing RH's inverse role in risk.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

- Forest Department Officials  
- Firefighters and Emergency Responders  
- Environmental NGOs and Activists  
- Academics and Students in Environmental Sciences  
- Policy Makers and Local Authorities  

## ðŸ§­ Scope & Limitations

- **Scope**: Focused on forest fire dynamics using recorded fire-day data.  
- **Limitations**:
  - No off-incident day weather data
  - Data quality issues due to manual collection
  - Lacks satellite-based surveillance context

## ðŸ’¡ Business & Environmental Implications

- Predictive risk modeling for resource deployment
- Public policy recommendations for restricted access zones
- Enhancing safety and reducing fire-fighting expenditure
- Potential for satellite surveillance integration

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

Our project provides an accessible, data-rich dashboard that allows stakeholders to identify high-risk periods and underlying fire causes. With regular data updates and model tuning, it can become a valuable asset in environmental monitoring and decision-making.
